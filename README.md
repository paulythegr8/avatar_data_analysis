# DATA ANALYSES
Welcome!! This is the repository where I will flex my analyst and data science skills :)

Currently I am working on the following:
* Avatar: The Last Airbender Basic Analysis (Using data analysis techniques to explore the shows ratings and what affected them) (Currently accessible via the atla_analysis.ipynb notebook file)

And in the future I will be adding
* Avatar: The Legend of Korra Basic Analysis
* Avatar: The Last Airbender Script Analysis (Digging through the scripts of each episode to see what relationships or trends I can uncover)
* Avatar: The Legend of Korra Script Analysis (Same as above)
* An analysis comparing Avatar: The Last Airbender and Avatar: The Legend of Korra

This repository is continually evolving, and notebooks that are already uploaded will almost certainly be added to, as there is a lot to discover.
I hope you find these informative and learn something interesting from these!!
